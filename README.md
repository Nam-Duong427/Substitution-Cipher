**This is a personal project base on available algorithm that I learned !** 

What it can do : to cipher the text base on generated key 

Attention : 
 - Must generate the key first, then enter your message.
 - To decrypt message, you must NOT close the current execution (because encryption and decryption must have the same key to work)

How to use ? 
 - You can create new project on your IDE and paste the code.
 - Enjoy!
